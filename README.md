# Microprocessor-and-Embedded-Systems-Project
## Development of an IoT based Bangla Calendar Clock 3.0 <br>
The basic goal of our project is to incorporate Time, Weekdays and Bangla Dates into a unique hardware clock with efficient power management system. The time and dates will be automatically synchronized with the standard time over the internet at regular intervals with the help of a Wi-fi module, since the time synchronization is based on the idea of the Internet of Things. Multiple LED matrices are used as the calendar clock display and a microcontroller is used as the main processing unit. Additionally, a Real Time Clock module ensures that the clock operates in offline mode. <br>
